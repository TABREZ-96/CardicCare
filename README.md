# Cardicare

Cardicare is a project that uses advanced machine learning and AI algorithms to detect heart disease from non-invasive medical data analysis. The project is aimed at helping medical professionals to diagnose and treat heart disease more accurately and efficiently.

## Installation

To install Cardicare, clone the project from Github using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/TABREZ-96/CardicCare


Once the project is cloned, install the necessary dependencies using the following command:  

```Pip install
```
## Library

Cardicare uses several Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. The following are the main libraries used in the project:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn import model_selection
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import xgboost as xgb
```

## Comparison Model
Cardicare implements several machine learning algorithms to detect heart disease. The following are the models used in the project for comparison:

1.SVM: A support vector machine algorithm, used for binary classification tasks.
2.KNN: A k-nearest neighbors algorithm, used for clustering and classification tasks.
3.Decision Tree: A decision tree algorithm, used for classification tasks.
4.XGBoost: An optimized distributed gradient boosting algorithm, used for ensemble modeling.

## Usage
To use Cardicare, run the 'Heart.py' file using the following command:

```python cardicare.py
```

The file will train a machine learning model on the provided dataset and display the results in a graphical user interface. The user can interact with the interface to analyze the results and view the accuracy of the model.
